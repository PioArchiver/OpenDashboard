1. Dated Note(1-30-2019): 
   1. In recent news it has been discussed that big tech companies take from open source but don't 
contribute to the projects that they take from.
   2. Thinking using the term `Open Software` or "Free Ware" for Kippikio projects.
   3. Kippikio Open Source Licenses will be modified to help protect rights of
people who have open source projects => So they will be NON OSI compliant.
